From now on you can track **outbound links** in A/B Testing for WordPress.

Now you're not bound to just pages and posts, but can also track if the user goes to a specific link.

Find this addition in the latest version of [A/B Testing for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ab-testing-for-wp/).

## Setup Outbound Link Tracking 

1. In the content editor, find the A/B test you wish to track outbound links.
2. Open the A/B tests' settings by clicking the cog.
3. Scroll down in the sidebar and select "Outbound link" under _Testing Goal_.
4. Enter the URL of the outbound link you want to track.

Whenever a user click a link on your website which directs the user to this URL, they will be added as a successful conversion of said test.
